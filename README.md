## Bag-of-words model

The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval. 
In this model, a text is represented as the bag of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.
The bag-of-words model has also been used for computer vision.

## What does tf-idf mean?

Tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. 
This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
